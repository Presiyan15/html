<h1>Principles For Clean HTML Code</h1>

<p><b>Beautiful and clean HTML</b> is the foundation of a beautiful website. When I teach people about <b>CSS</b>, I always begin by telling them that good <b>CSS</b> can only exist with equally good HTML markup. A house is<br>
    only as strong as its foundation, right? The advantages of <b>clean, semantic HTML</b> are many, yet so many websites suffer from poorly written markup.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Strict DOCTYPE</b>. If we are going to do this, let’s just do it right. No need for a discussion about whether to use <i>HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0</i>: both of them offer a strict version that will keep us nice and honest as<br>
    we write our code.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Character set & encoding characters</b>. In our < head > section, the very first thing should be the <b>declaration</b> of our character set. We’re using <b>UTF-8</b> here, which is swell, but it’s listed after our < title >. Let’s go<br>
         ahead and move it up so that the browser knows what character set it’s dealing with before it starts reading any content at all.<br>
        <br>
    The next time you write <b>HTML</b>, be it a small chunk in a huge website, or the beginning of a fresh new project, just do what you can to make it <b>right</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <i>The interwebs will love you!</i></p>
